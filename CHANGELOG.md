## [0.8.0] - 2025-02-03

### Added

- Python package with CLI (`gen-ext`) for automated project generation
- `gen-ext init` command to create projects from gen~ exports
- `gen-ext build` command to compile externals
- `gen-ext detect` command to analyze gen~ exports (buffers, I/O, parameters)
- `gen-ext patch` command to apply platform-specific fixes
- Automatic buffer detection from gen~ export code
- Automatic exp2f -> exp2 patch for macOS compatibility
- JSON output option for `detect` command
- Dry-run mode for `init` and `patch` commands
- Comprehensive test suite (42 tests)
- **Max/MSP platform support** with CMake build system
  - Generates Max externals (.mxo on macOS, .mxe64 on Windows)
  - Uses max-sdk-base submodule for SDK integration (auto-cloned by `build` command)
  - Native 64-bit signal processing (matches Max's double precision)
  - Thread-safe buffer access via t_buffer_ref lock/unlock API
  - Isolated compilation units to avoid type conflicts between Max SDK and genlib

### Changed

- Converted from manual template-based workflow to Python package
- Templates now bundled inside the package
- Examples moved to test fixtures

### Removed

### Notes

- Targets Organelle synth but works on macOS and Linux
